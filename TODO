Vectors everywhere
    3D
    GLSL-like member accessing (e.g. vec.xy, vec.xz, vec.rba, ..)
    Unpacking (.asColor(), .asCoordinates())
    @ operator for vector product
    * operator for dot product

Better Collision System
    Lots of heuristics before the real stuff kicks in

3D Support
    Cameras (Perspectives)
        with camera: ...

Text from stream (function(args) -> str)
    The text will only read the stream inbetween draw calls
    Perfect match for `getText()`
    Stream from file (?)

Misc
    Eel.setFPS -> Locks FPS
